              Measuring your flour by dimension (cups or deciliters) will give
              you different results each time and baking is all about
              consistency. Also, any recipe maker worth their salt measures
              their ingredients in grams.

              The scale should measure at least down to the gram, but preferably
              as low as 0.1g which can be common when measuring dry yeast or
              salt.

              why I always use a stand mixer to do all the hard work for you.
              They are expensive though ($400 and up), so only buy one if you

              Dough is sticky, especially before you've developed enough gluten
              strength. A dough scraper is a good way to keep your hands and
              your dough containers nice and clean. I recommend getting one in
              plastic to use to get all the dough out of the container. And also
              a metal one to use for shaping the doughs.

            <Text>
              After baking a pizza or bread it unfortunately needs to cool for a
              bit (3-4 minutes for pizza, 30 minutes for bread) before you can
              devour it. If you immediately put the pizza or bread on a flat
              surface the bottom can become soggy. To prevent this you can put
              it on a cooling rack!

              If you don't have a fancy oven that can produce steam you will
              need a Dutch oven to be able to get a proper rise on your bread.
              This is because the Dutch oven captures all the steam that the
              dough evaporates and traps it, thus delaying the crust of the
              bread to form too quickly, letting the bread rise as much as
              possible. <br />
              <br />I know <b>Le Creuset</b> is the bomb, but don't buy their
              Dutch oven just for baking, it's way too expensive.

              When making bread you often need to score it. This is because you
              want to control the rise of the dough so it doesn't explode. Some
              people use a knife for this, which is not aaaaaanywhere as sharp
              as it needs to be. Buy a pair of razor blades and thank me later.

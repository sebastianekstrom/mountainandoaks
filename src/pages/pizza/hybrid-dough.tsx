              This dough is the result of me experimenting with two different
              doughs; the New York style and the Neopolitan style. It uses{" "}
              poolish, which is a pre-fermented dough that you make the day
              before and later incorporate into the dough. The poolish will
              greatly increase the flavor and texture of the pizza.

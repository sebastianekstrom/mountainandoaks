        Chop the mirepoix (celery, onion, carrot) into smaller pieces, it

        If you don't have a food processor, finely, finely chop the mirepoix and

        Let the sauce <b>cook for 90 minutes</b> without a lid. The goal is to

        the bottom of the pan with a spatula and the sauce should not try to
        fill the space. If it starts to thicken too much before 90 minutes has
        passed, add a splash of water.

        If the sauce is too watery it'll make the pirogi very gooey and just

        Wrap the bowl with plastic wrap, or a wet kitchen towel, to prevent it

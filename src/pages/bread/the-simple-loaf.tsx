		Preheat your Dutch oven by placing it in the oven set to <b>250째C/482째F</b>.

		If a Dutch oven is not available, a baking sheet can serve as a substitute.

		Try to shape the dough as tight as possible.

		<b>Score the top of the dough</b> using a razor blade or a sharp knife. This

	<Text extra={<MethodImage src={image9} alt="" />}>
		If using a Dutch oven, place its lid back on before putting it in the oven.
		For a baking sheet, spritz the dough with a small amount of water before
		placing it in the oven. This water layer will delay the formation of a
		crust, thus promoting the bread's rise.
	</Text>,
	<Text>
		Once the bread is in the oven, promptly reduce the temperature to{" "}
		<b>220째C / 428째F</b>.
	</Text>,
	<Text>
		After the first <b>20 minutes</b> of baking, remove the Dutch oven lid, if
		using one.
	</Text>,
	<Text>
		Continue baking for an additional <b>20 more minutes</b>, or until the crust
		turns a golden-brown color.
	</Text>,
	<Text extra={<MethodImage src={image10} alt="" />}>
		Your bread is now ready! Carefully remove it from the oven and place it on a
		cooling rack. <b>Let it rest for at least 30 minutes</b> before slicing and
		serving. <br />
		<br />
		Enjoy your homemade bread!

    Start kneading the dough. If you have a stand mixer mix it for 3 minutes on
    low speed to combine the dough, and then 5 minutes on medium to develop
    gluten strength. If you knead by hand, knead for 10 minutes. <br />

    Grab your dutch oven and put it in the oven and set it to <b>250째C/482째F</b>
    . If you don't have a dutch oven use a baking sheet. I do however highly
    recommend getting one, you can read more about the benefits of a dutch oven{" "}

    Cover the bowl with a damp towel or plastic wrap and let it proof for{" "}

    Place the dough on a piece of parchment paper to prevent it from sticking.
    Take out your dutch oven, or baking sheet, out from the oven and place the
    dough on it

    <b>Score the bread</b> with a razor blade or a really sharp knife. This is
    because we want to control the rise of the bread. If you don't score it the
    bread might &quot;explode&quot; on the sides which means we won't get a good
    rise. You can watch{" "}
    <Link href="https://youtu.be/wfoC-daJq8E?t=192">this video</Link> for some
    good scoring techniques

    If you're using a dutch oven, cover it with the lid and place it in the
    oven. If you're using a baking sheet, spray the dough with a tiny bit of
    water and place it in the oven. The spray of water will prevent the crust
    from forming too quickly, thus allowing the bread to rise
  </Text>,
  <Text>
    As soon as the bread is in the oven, lower the temperature to{" "}
    <b>220째C / 428째F</b>
  </Text>,
  <Text>
    After <b>20 minutes</b> remove the lid from the dutch oven, if you're using
    one
  </Text>,
  <Text>
    Bake for <b>20 more minutes</b> until the crust is golden brown
  </Text>,
  <Text extra={<MethodImage src={image1} alt="" />}>
    All done, take out the bread from the oven and place it on a cooling rack.
    Let it rest for at least <b>30 minutes</b>

            A basic, simple and delicious loaf of bread that only takes around
            2-3 hours to bake! The hydration is relatively low which makes it
            easy to handle, but high enough to produce a juicy and delicious
            loaf.
